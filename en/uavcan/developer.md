# UAVCAN Development

General documentation on [UAVCAN](http://uavcan.org) can be found in: [Hardware > UAVCAN Peripherals](../uavcan/README.md).

This topic/section has information that is relevant to developers (or at least largely irrelevant to end users).

## Upgrading Node Firmware

The PX4 middleware will automatically upgrade firmware on UAVCAN nodes if the matching firmware is supplied.
The process and requirements are described on the [UAVCAN Firmware](../uavcan/node_firmware.md) page.

### Debugging with Zubax Babel

A great tool to debug the transmission on the UAVCAN bus is the [Zubax Babel](https://zubax.com/products/babel) in combination with the [GUI tool](http://uavcan.org/GUI_Tool/Overview/).

They can also be used independently from Pixhawk hardware in order to test a node or manually control UAVCAN enabled ESCs.
