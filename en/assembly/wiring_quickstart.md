# Wiring Quickstart

This section contains wiring information for a "minimal" autopilot system using a number of different flight controllers.

> **Tip** Quickstart guides are only provided for a few controllers. Other controllers will have similar connections. Additional information may be available in [flight controllers](../flight_controller/README.md) pages or in manufacturer documentation.
