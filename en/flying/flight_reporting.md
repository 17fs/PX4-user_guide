# Flight Reporting

PX4 logs detailed aircraft performance data once the system has been armed until it is disarmed. These flight logs can also be used to analyze performance issues.

> **Tip** Keeping flight logs is a legal requirement in some jurisdictions. 

## Downloading Logs from the Flight Controller

Logs can be downloaded using [QGroundControl](http://qgroundcontrol.com/) (v3.2 or later): **Analyze View > Log Download**.
