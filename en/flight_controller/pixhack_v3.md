# Pixhack V3

The CUAV *Pixhack V3* autopilot is a flexible autopilot intended primarily for manufacturers of commercial systems.  
It is a variant of the hardware based on PH2 (SOLO pixhawk2), but it is fully compatible with APM OR PX4 code.
It is based on the [Pixhawk-project](https://pixhawk.org/) **FMUv3** open hardware design and runs PX4 on the [NuttX](http://nuttx.org) OS.

The controller is designed to be used with a domain-specific carrier board in order to reduce the wiring, improve reliability, and ease of assembly. For example, a carrier board for a commercial inspection vehicle might include connections for a companion computer, while a carrier board for a racer could includes ESCs form the frame of the vehicle.
