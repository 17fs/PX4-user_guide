# FrSky Telemetry

PX4 supports D (old) and S (new) FrSky telemetry.Â FMUv4 based boards
(Pixracer) include the required electronics for the interface, older
boards (Pixhawk) need a UART to S.PORT adapter board.



## Pixracer

> **Success** FrSky telemetry auto-starts on Pixracer and
  detects D or S mode, there is no need to configure anything.

For receivers with D-port (D4R-II and similar): Connect the Pixracer
FrSky TX line to the D4R-II RX line. Also connect GND.

For receivers with S-port: Connect the Pixracer FrSky TX and RX lines
together (solder the wires together) to the X series receiver's S.port
pin. Also connect GND.


## Cable/adapter sources

Ready-made cables are available from:
* [Craft and Theory](http://www.craftandtheoryllc.com/telemetry-cable). Versions are available with DF-13 compatible *PicoBlade connectors* (for FMUv2/3DR Pixhawk, FMUv2/HKPilot32) and *JST-GH connectors* (for FMUv3/Pixhawk 2 "The Cube" and FMUv4/PixRacer v1).
