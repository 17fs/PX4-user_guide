# AirSpeed Calibration

For airspeed calibration you will need to keep your airspeed sensor out of any wind and then blow across the sensor.

> **Note** Fixed Wing and VTOL vehicles usually have an airspeed sensor.

## Performing the Calibration 

To calibrate the airspeed sensor:

1. Start *QGroundControl* and connect the vehicle.
1. Select the **Gear** icon (Vehicle Setup) in the top toolbar and then **Sensors** in the sidebar.
1. Click the **Airspeed** sensor button.

1. Cover the sensor (i.e. with your hand).

   > **Warning** Do not touch the sensor (obstruct any holes) during calibration.
   
1. Click **OK** to start the calibration.
1. Blow across the sensor.
1. Wait for 2-3 seconds before removing the covering (calibration completes silently after several seconds)
